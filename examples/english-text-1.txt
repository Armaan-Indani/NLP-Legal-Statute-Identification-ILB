A college student, Neeraj Sharma, rented a motorbike through a short-term app-based service. Instead of returning it at the agreed time, he altered the vehicle’s license plate and sold it to a local mechanic using a forged registration certificate. The company tracked the bike using GPS, leading police to the mechanic’s workshop, where the tampered documents were recovered.
Neeraj initially denied involvement but later confessed after digital payment records and CCTV footage from the sale were presented. The investigation established clear evidence of vehicle theft, identity concealment, and use of forged documents. If convicted, Neeraj faces imprisonment, a monetary penalty, and suspension of his driving license.
