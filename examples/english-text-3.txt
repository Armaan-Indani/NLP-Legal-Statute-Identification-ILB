A 27-year-old man, Arjun Verma, was accused of sexually assaulting a 22-year-old woman who lived in the same neighborhood. The two had met at a local event and exchanged contact information. Days later, Arjun invited her to his residence under the pretext of discussing a community project. Once inside, he locked the door and assaulted her despite her repeated resistance.
The victim immediately reported the incident to the police and underwent a medical examination, which confirmed physical injuries consistent with her statement. Investigators seized Arjun’s phone, which contained messages showing he had pressured her to remain silent. DNA samples taken from both individuals matched evidence collected from the scene.
Arjun was taken into custody and charged after the forensic report corroborated the complaint. Witness statements, digital records, and medical evidence established a strong case against him. If convicted, he faces a prison sentence and monetary fine, along with mandatory registration as a sexual offender.
