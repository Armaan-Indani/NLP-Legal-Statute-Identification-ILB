Ravi Kumar, a 32-year-old shop owner, lived in a small town with his business partner, Anil. Over several months, their relationship deteriorated due to financial disputes and accusations of theft from the shop’s earnings. Witnesses later reported heated arguments between them.
One evening, after a verbal altercation at the store, Ravi followed Anil to his residence carrying a kitchen knife. Neighbors heard shouting, followed by a single loud scream. Anil was later found dead in his courtyard with multiple stab wounds. Ravi fled the scene but was arrested two days later in a nearby district.
Forensic evidence confirmed Anil’s blood on Ravi’s clothes and fingerprints on the weapon. Ravi confessed during interrogation, stating that anger and humiliation led him to the act. The prosecution built a strong case supported by eyewitness accounts, physical evidence, and Ravi’s own statement.
If found guilty, Ravi faces imprisonment for life or capital punishment, depending on judicial assessment of intent and circumstances.
